// A7b (work/a7b, candidate 0.0.1-a7b, 2026-11-02), with A7_FIX: new output cfg = the PHY's cfg_done (PSRAM 1 configured),
// for pk_reset's boot_done; `ready` (configured and the clear done) still holds the core's reset. On the Pocket, A7's
// boot_done waiting 10.3 ms for the clear made the firmware refuse the core ("Error in framework RS: Host commands
// ignored", hardware test 5); with cfg, APF's "booting" status ends as early as A6's and the clear overlaps the slot loads
// (they write PSRAM 0 only). Without A7_FIX there is no cfg port.
// A7 (work/a7, candidate 0.0.1-a7, 2026-11-02), only with `define A7_FIX (needs FB0_PSRAM and A6_DBG; without A7_FIX the
// file is A6's, apart from the alias q_rst = rst): the frame-buffer clear at core start. After the PHY has configured
// PSRAM 1 (its cfg_done) and before `ready` rises (pk_reset: ps_ready, so boot_done and the core's reset wait for it),
// every word of both dies at word addresses 0 .. 0x3FFFF (each place an FB layout can put a buffer: A[17] and the die)
// is written with 0x0000: 16,384 write bursts of 32 words, both byte enables on, die 0 first, in address order. The
// frame buffers then start transparent, as MiSTer's on-chip buffers after configuration (the PSRAM keeps its contents
// across core loads, and areas a game never draws or erases showed them). It runs once per power-on of the memory glue
// (rst = pk_reset's por_ram), never on a Core Settings or APF reset. Meanwhile the request side (both queues, the
// line-buffer prefetch, the arbiter) is held in reset (q_rst), so no queue command can reach the PHY (a queue sees
// m_ready from the PHY's cmd_ready whoever drives the command: an empty queue cannot be "taken"); the clear drives the
// PHY's command and write-data inputs (clr_on). `ready` rises when the PHY is idle again after the last burst; the
// queues leave reset one clk_ram after the clear ends (then their data-area sweep, 256 clk_ram, with full set). Time:
// 36 PSRAM cycles per burst (LC 2 + 32 words + address cycle + CE# high) = 72 clk_ram, x 16,384 = 1,179,648 clk_ram
// (11.0 ms at 107.4 MHz) added before boot_done.
// A6 (work/a6, diagnostic build 0.0.1-a6dbg, 2026-11-01), only with `define A6_DBG (needs FB0_PSRAM; without A6_DBG the
// file is A5's). Core Settings options for bisecting the hardware-only frame-buffer static of 0.0.1-a5 (clk_sys inputs,
// registered here in clk_ram: clk_sys -> clk_ram is synchronous; a change takes effect at the next PHY command):
//   dbg_layout  where the two buffers live in PSRAM 1, as {die, A[21:0]} with A[17] the offset bit (cmd_addr below):
//                 0 = A5: FB0 die 1, FB1 die 0 (word 0 of each)       1 = both in die 0: FB1 at word 0, FB0 at 0x20000
//                 2 = both in die 1: FB0 at word 0, FB1 at 0x20000     3 = swapped: FB0 die 0, FB1 die 1
//               (layouts 1 and 2: no die interleaving; layout 0 = A5 exactly)
//   dbg_wcoff   1 = draw / CPU writes (FBD side) are never combined (fb_queue req_nm): each is a one-word PSRAM write
//               with its own byte enables, so no multi-word write burst carries a masked (be = 00) or partial word.
//               Erase writes (FBE side: full words at ascending addresses, no flow control) still combine, so the
//               V-blank erase (one write per 4 clk_ram) cannot overflow the queue; their bursts have no holes.
//               Line-buffer reads unchanged.
//   dbg_gap2    1 = two PSRAM cycles of CE# high between accesses (psram_phy gap2)
//   dbg_clr     1 = debug flags off: the sticky flags are held clear (switching the flags on starts a new watch)
// Sticky flags (dbg_flags, clk_ram; cleared at power-on and while dbg_clr):
//   [0] fb_queue 0 overflow (FB0's queue: a request with no room = a lost write; also its protocol checks)
//   [1] fb_queue 1 overflow (FB1's queue)
//   [2] display underrun: a display read (V-blank over, the raster's line y = c_fbv_a[17:10] != 255, word x =
//       c_fbv_a[9:1] < 352) whose 32-word block x[8:5] has not fully arrived in the line-buffer half y[0] from the
//       half's current fill (lb_done: bursts completed since the fill started). Armed only after the raster has shown
//       y = 255 in this active period (u_arm), so the one clk_sys after V-blank in which OUT_Y still holds EWLR.Y1, and
//       the core's reset, are not counted; y = 255 itself (the line before line 0; a displayed line only in 256-line
//       modes, a known A3/A5 limitation) is not checked.
//   [3] / [4] READ WAIT anomaly on die 0 / die 1 of PSRAM 1 (psram_phy dbg_rw)
//   [5] / [6] WRITE WAIT anomaly on die 0 / die 1 of PSRAM 1 (psram_phy dbg_ww)
//   [7] PSRAM 0 WAIT anomaly, READ or WRITE, either die (input dbg_ext from psram0_arb's PHY: the same monitors on the
//       chip that holds the CPUs' memory, as a control)
//   dbg_disp = c_sel: the buffer being displayed (0 = FB0, 1 = FB1).
// A5 (work/a5, 2026-11-01) option (b), `ifdef FB0_PSRAM (qsf VERILOG_MACRO "FB0_PSRAM=1"): frame buffer 0 lives in PSRAM 1's
// die 1 (unused before) instead of the SRAM, which the Pocket's 55 ns part (AS6C2016-55) makes too slow for the display
// role (hardware test 2; work/a5/REPORT.txt). Frame buffer 1 stays in die 0. Both queues are then the PSRAM kind (block
// write combining with PS_BWC), so the two buffers behave the same, and they share the one PHY through a two-way
// arbiter (below: the display buffer's queue first). The SRAM is not used: its pins idle (WE#, OE#, UB#, LB# high, DQ
// released). Without FB0_PSRAM this file is A3's.
// A2 (work/a2, timing closure, 2026-10-31): the core's request signals (FB_SEL, FBD_*, FBE_*, FBV_A for the queues
// and the line-buffer fills, FBV_VB) go through a clk_ram capture register (c_*) before the request logic, which
// works one clk_ram later than before (the display read FBV_Q still uses the core's FBV_A directly; the write data
// FBD_D / FBE_D are taken from the core directly: the VDP1 holds FB_D from a request until its next one, at least two
// clk_sys later, and FBE_D is the EWDR register). The VDP1 looks at
// FB_RDY at the earliest one clk_sys after a read request (the read word is there when FB_RDY is back) and two clk_sys
// after a write request (FS_DRAW / FS_CPU_WRITE, then FS_IDLE): FB_RDY now also drops for a read request that is in
// the capture register and not yet pending (d_rd), and a write's queue count is there one clk_ram before FS_IDLE
// looks at it (before: two).
// vdp1fb_ext: the VDP1's two frame buffers off-chip on the Pocket (option (b) of glue/REPORT.txt):
//   frame buffer 0 = the SRAM (fb_sram), frame buffer 1 = PSRAM 1 (psram_phy, die 0, words 0-131071).
// Each memory has one role per frame, as the two frame-buffer DRAMs of the real VDP1: the draw buffer (drawing, CPU
// accesses, read-modify-write) or the display buffer (raster read-out, erase-while-displaying, V-blank erase),
// swapped with FB_SEL. Every request goes, in order, into the queue of the memory that holds its buffer
// (fb_queue: write combining for sequential writes); so a read sees every earlier write to its buffer.
//
// Core interface (VDP1 with `VDP1_FB_EXT, clk_sys domain; see glue/core/vdp1_fbext.diff):
//   FB_SEL         1: frame buffer 0 (SRAM) is the draw buffer, 1 (PSRAM) is displayed
//   FBD_*          draw / CPU side: A, D, WE (one-clk pulses), RD (one-clk pulse for draw reads, held for CPU
//                  reads); FBD_Q holds the last read word; FB_RDY = no read outstanding and room in the queue
//                  (the VDP1 waits on it before every draw / CPU access and for read data)
//   FBV_A, FBV_Q   display side: the raster address; FBV_Q = the word at the address of the previous clk_sys, as
//                  the on-chip M10K gave it (it comes from a two-line buffer filled ahead of the raster)
//   FBE_WE, FBE_D  erase writes (EWDR) to the display buffer at FBV_A
//   FBV_VB         vertical blank (VTIM_N low): no line fills
// The line buffer (two halves of 384 words): the half of the displayed line Y (FBV_A[17:10]) holds line Y and the
// other half line Y + 1, read ahead in 12 bursts of 32 words while line Y is shown; at the end of V-blank (Y = 255)
// lines 0 and 1 are read (alternating bursts), and again from the new display buffer when FB_SEL toggles (the
// frame change, ~23 dots before line 0 is shown). No fills in V-blank (FBV_VB). Erase writes reach the memory after the line was read (they are
// queued behind its reads), as the original read-then-erase per pixel.
// Clocks: clk_ram = 2 x clk_sys, phase aligned (the core's requests are seen on the clk_ram edge in the middle of
// their clk_sys cycle, so FB_RDY drops before the next clk_sys edge, as MiSTer's ddram.sv busy flags do).
// M10K: the line buffer (1,024 x 16: 2); the queues' FIFOs are MLABs.
